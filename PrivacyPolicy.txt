Privacy Policy

 

Introduction

 

At Our Team ("We," "us," or "our"), we are dedicated to safeguarding the privacy of our users ("you"). This Privacy Policy is designed to inform you about our practices regarding the collection, use, and storage of your personal data when you engage with our application (the "App"). We urge you to read this Privacy Policy thoroughly to comprehend our commitment to your privacy. By engaging with the App, you are consenting to the stipulations of this Privacy Policy. We may modify this policy occasionally. Should any changes occur, we will notify you by updating the policy on the App or our website, and through other suitable channels. Your continued use of the Services after such changes implies your consent to the updated policy.

Non-personally identifiable data collected may include device type, version, brand, language, network type and operator, mobile operating system, device identifiers (e.g., IDFA, IDFV), country, access times and duration, app usage behavior, page views, and click-through statistics.

Personal data collected may include your name, birth date, gender, phone number, email address, account name, and other demographic information that helps identify you, including data from Facebook if you register using your Facebook credentials.

2. Data Usage

 

The purposes for data collection include:

 

To provide and enhance our Services, confirm identity, establish contact, and deliver targeted advertising.

For security measures and integrity of the system (preventing hacking, cheating, and other unauthorized or illegal activities).

To ensure compliance with legal obligations.

3. Data Sharing

 

We do not sell, trade, or rent your data. We collaborate with third parties and service providers like subcontractors, affiliates, retailers, fulfillment partners, and marketing partners to support our Services, and may share data to assist these efforts, under strict privacy and security requirements, in line with Appleâ€™s Privacy rules.

 

4. Data Protection

Your data is retained for as long as necessary to provide the Services, for the original collection purposes, to meet legal requirements, or until a deletion request is made.
